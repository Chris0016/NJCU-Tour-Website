          <p>
            The New Jersey City University (NJCU) main campus is a mix slew of buildings that have contrasting architectures and styles. Many of the buildings were made at different time periods where the cultures and styles varied. Hence, in one way or another each building is representing something some its corresponding time.  For instance, the oldest buildings like Hepburn, which was built around 1929, have a gothic architecture. This symbolizes how the iconic college buildings that people from that era thought should look like.  
          </p>
          <p>
            While on the other hand, the Karnoutsous(K-building) building can be described as outstanding and a stark contrast to Hepburn Hall. The building is seated adjacent to the Fries Hall(art) and Hepburn. The K-building has an assortment of pastel like colors and is a much taller in comparison to Hepburn Hall. According to its designers, the K-building is meant to showcase how “various arts and science components would be integrated with the adjoining Fries Hall, shape the building and define a new quadrangle with the student center.”(Graves). The project was completed in 2006, and currently holds a variety of departments including Computer Science, Mathematics.  
          </p>
          <p>
            It can be said that the three buildings mentioned are the greatest contributors to making NJCU distinct and speak to its personality.

                “In 2006, the University dedicated a six-story, 77,000-square-foot, George Karnoutsos Arts and Sciences Hall. It was designed by renowned architect Michael Graves in collaboration with STV Architects of New York. The building of modular precast concrete features a pyramid tower that heightens the structure and an entrance with distinctive portico columns. It is named for Dr. Karnoutsos, a 1955 alumnus and retired professor of philosophy, who donated $2.5 million to the University. It also dedicated the William J. Maxwell College of Arts and Sciences in honor of Dr. Maxwell, a 1958 alumnus, former history professor, Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, former president, president emeritus, and distinguished service professor of history and education.”

          <p>
            From a city planning perspective, at first glance the odd mix of colors and styles represent a campus whose building don’t mesh well together. The large differences make some buildings feel out of place within the campus, which doesn’t equate to a place that inspires awe, but instead questioning. However, when considering that each of the buildings was built to represent different time periods, ideas, or goals then a new appreciation for the buildings comes into play. From my view, the different styles don’t necessarily serve an aesthetic purpose, but rather has a more abstract and deeper meaning that serves culture and history. They are there not only host classes, but also represent the people that were there before us, as well as what to look for in the future. 
          </p>
          
          <h2>Is it obvious where the main hubs of this campus are located? </h2>
          <p>
            Arguably, the main hubs of the school are GSUB and Hepburn Hall. GSUB hosts the cafeteria and many different departments that offer student services. Hepburn Hall is the center of anything dealing with finances, executives, registrations, or any other major service the university offers.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The campus is arranged in such a way that there is no centerpiece, rather the buildings are configured in a mesh network. Although it's not a large campus, it can be a sore to walk from one section of the campus to another because of the indirect navigation. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Hepburn hall is quite distinguishable due to its architecture and is also the first building off the main entrance, so it is not difficult to find. However, GSUB is in a further corner of the campus, far from the main entrance. Therefore, it is not very easily found when compared to Hepburn.   As a student that works in NJCU, I’ve had quite a few students and guests ask for the location of GSUB, which hints towards its visibility. There are several maps around the school, but many of these seem to be outdated in design or are not positioned in the most useful areas like in checkpoints along the path to GSUB from the entrance.   
          </p>
          <h2>What's missing?  </h2>
          <p>One of the biggest things that college campuses of NJCU size are known for is a green space or lawn where students can just relax and enjoy the space. Like for instance the one shown below.</p>
          <figure >
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/City Planning/main-fordham.jpg" alt="Fordham Campus Lawn" /> 
            <figurecaption>Fordham University, Credit: Google.com</figurecaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Within the NJCU campus there are approximately two spots that offer some greenery. With the first being the entrance lawn. </p>
          <figure>
            <img class="img-fluid " style="margin-left: 12%;" src="img/City Planning/main-entrance.jpg" alt="NJCU Campus" /> <br />
            <figurecaption>New Jersey City University, Credit: Google.com</figurecaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And another behind Hepburn Hall. However, it is extremely rare to see any students laying there. Whether the area was designated to be a place to sit is a question whose answer is not clear. Assuming that it was meant as a place to sit, then one of the reasons why it is not successful it because of its location. If we take for instance the Fordham example, the lawn is in the center where it is shielded from any outside traffic and surrounded by trees. In contrast, the lawn at NJCU is next to a busy car street and is not covered by a lot of trees.  </p>
          <p>An argument against having a lawn space for students might be that NJCU is a commuter school and therefore does not need to have one. This idea can be easily disregarded because, even students that don’t dorm can take multiple classes in a day with spaces in between and will often find themselves sitting in random spots. Of course, many students are seen in GSUB waiting for their next class but having the option to experience the outdoors and getting a breath of fresh air is an experience that is difficult to replace. A college campus is more than just a series of paved walkways connecting department buildings. It's a place that's intended to be used. It's a space where students and professors may unwind, study, and socialize. It's supposed to be a place where students feel protected and at ease. </p>
          <h2>Is it safe? </h2>
          <p>Whether the campus is safe or not is difficult to measure quantitatively. Nevertheless, a count of women walking in the surrounding area can be a good indicator of the safety index. This conclusion is supported by Jan Gehl's text of <i>How to Study Public Life</i>, when he sites “One possible indicator for whether a park is safe is the presence of a sufficient number of women. ” (pg. 14). Although the measure is applied for parks in the given example, the same thought process can be applied to neighborhoods, because in general it can be said that women are much less likely to walk in areas where they don’t feel safe.  </p>

          </table>
          <p>As the data shows, the percentage of women seen range from 33% to 51% over the three samples taken. This demonstrates that the surrounding area can be described as safe for the most part during the day time. It can be noted that a sharp drop in the number of women seen in the area occurs after dark, which is also suggestive that the area is not safe after certain time periods. </p>
          
          <h2>Foot Traffic (People count, Who/What/Where, more places crowded than others) </h2>
          <p>The greatest number of people can be observed Monday through Wednesdays. Like any other college campus, the majority of people are young adults in their early 20s, although some older faculty can also be seen on campus from time to time. There is no place that has a noticeable greater number of people, since the campus is organized in a manner where the buildings are all distributed throughout without no centerpiece.</p>
