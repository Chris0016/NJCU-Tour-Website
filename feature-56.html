                Experencing Route 440 and the Hudson Mall
              </h1>
              <div
                class="map-wrap"
                style="width: 100%; height: 445px; margin-top: 10px"

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            On the area surrounding the Hudson mall there is very little foot
            traffic, and the reason become apparently only after trying to
            access it. The final crossing to Hudson mall is a 6 six lane traffic
            intersection with many busy cars. Although it may not sound like
            much, having such a crowded lane gives the area a sense of hostility
            as one walks along the desolate sidewalks that sit next to such mass
            of traffic passing by at high speeds. Hence, from an accessibility
            standpoint the Hudson mall seems to be meant to be accessed by car.
            Furthermore, to even get to the store one needs to walk across large
            parking lots. So overall, accessing the Hudson mall on foot is an
            ordeal in it of itself.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Is It Important?</h2>
          <p>
            Whether a mall can be accessed by foot might not seem relevant at
            first glance, but the issue does come into play when a good deal of
            its customers can be potential university students or residents
            living in West Campus or coming from NJCU. While it is true that
            many people in the state have cars, there is also a good number of
            people not being accounted for that do not own a car. This implies
            that if students cannot easily access the mall, then many of them
            will simply only go when it is necessary, which doesn’t not seem
            like a good business model for a mall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more, when the issue is looked at from a student perspective,
            as a student I find it cumbersome and exhausting to have to travel
            to a place that feels so far and hostile. The same issue is
            encountered by a multitude of residents of whom I’ve asked who find
            it a chore to go to a nearby store.
          </p>
          <p>
            This raises greater concern about why there is such a small number
            of stores in the nearby area or the ones that exist are hard to
            access. Being that NJCU is a rather medium sized school with a large
            number of students coming about during class days even if some
            online classes persist, there is a very small number of stores in
            the area.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Is it more beneficial that NJCU is in a residential area rather than
            a commercial one?
          </h2>
          <p>
            NJCU is built upon a residential area and therefore provides some
            reasoning why there aren’t many stores in place. However, would the
            overall community of Jersey City benefit more if there was a closer
            and modern shopping district surrounding NJCU?
          </p>
          <p>
            The short answer is yes. At the moment, there is a lot of untapped
            potential in terms of financial growth in the area. NJCU hosts over
            5,000 students and faculty, there are multiple schools in the
            surrounding area that each hold at least 400 students, and lastly
            John F. Kennedy boulevard is teaming with car traffic. All these
            factors make a great recipe for a closer shopping district that is
            modern. Of course, the shopping district of feature 3 was mentioned,
            but there are many flaws with this district with the first being
            that is far from campus. Nonetheless, the stores are antiquated and
            don’t host brands that attract college students.
          </p>
          <p>
            To summarize, The Jersey City community would benefit greatly if the
            area around NJCU was built like the college town it was meant to be
            instead of mediocre housing complexes that bring down the value of
            NJCU along with it.
